# Quasar Framework Default App Template
> Default Starter Kit for a Quasar Framework Project. Compatible with Quasar v0.9-v0.14

> **DEPRECATED FOR v0.15+**

## Usage
Use Quasar CLI to generate a new project using this template:

``` bash
# install Quasar CLI if you don't have it already
$ npm install -g quasar-cli

# generate a project folder with this template
$ quasar init my-project

$ cd my-project
$ npm install
$ quasar dev
```

# Quasar Framework
> Build responsive websites, PWAs, hybrid mobile Apps (that look native!) and Electron apps using same code, powered with Vue.

## Contributing

I'm excited if you want to contribute to Quasar under any form (report bugs, write a plugin, fix an issue, write a new feature).

### Issue Reporting Guidelines

**Please use the appropriate Github repo to report issues. See "Related Components" above.** For example, a bug related to CLI should be reported to the CLI repo, one related to build issues to Quasar Framework Templates repo and so on.

- The issue list of the repository is **exclusively** for bug reports and feature requests. For anything else please use the [Community Forum](http://forum.quasar-framework.org).

- Try to search for your issue, it may have already been fixed in the development branch or it may have a resolution.

- Check if the issue is reproducible with the latest stable version of Quasar. If you are using a pre-release, please indicate the specific version you are using.

- It is **required** that you clearly describe the steps necessary to reproduce the issue you are running into. Issues with no clear repro steps will not be triaged. If an issue labeled "need repro" receives no further input from the issue author for more than 5 days, it will be closed.

- If your issue is resolved but still open, donâ€™t hesitate to close it. In case you found a solution by yourself, it could be helpful to explain how you fixed it.

## Quasar Play App

Instead of using mobile emulators for testing your Quasar Apps, use this App instead. You can develop apps directly on your phone/tablet (hot reload supported!), without even installing your app.

Currently only on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.quasarframework.quasarplay&utm_source=global_co&utm_medium=prtnr&utm_content=Mar2515&utm_campaign=PartBadge&pcampaignid=MKT-Other-global-all-co-prtnr-py-PartBadge-Mar2515-1). Requiring funding to pay fees on Apple Store and release the iOS counterpart too.
